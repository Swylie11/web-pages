    <p>Horned Lizards are pretty cool for a variety of reasons</p>
    <ol>
        <li>They're spiky and look cool.</li>
        <li>They shoot blood from their eyes as a defense mechanism which is metal as hell.</li>
        <li>They are the state animal of Texas.</li>
        <li>Did I mention they shoot blood from their eyes?</li>
        <li>Also the blood is purposely disgusting to predators and smells foul.</li>

        Phrynosoma, whose members are known as the horned lizards, horny toads, or horntoads, is a genus of North American lizards and the type genus of the family Phrynosomatidae. Their common names refer directly to their horns or to their flattened, rounded bodies (squat bodied), and blunt snouts.

The generic name Phrynosoma means "toad-bodied". In common with true toads (amphibians of the family Bufonidae), horned lizards tend to move sluggishly, often remain motionless, and rely on their remarkable camouflage to avoid detection by predators. They are adapted to arid or semiarid areas. The spines on the lizard's back and sides are modified reptile scales, which prevent water loss through the skin, whereas the horns on the head are true horns (i.e., they have a bony core). A urinary bladder is absent.[1] Of the 21 species of horned lizards, 15 are native to the US. The largest-bodied and most widely distributed of the American species is the Texas horned lizard.
